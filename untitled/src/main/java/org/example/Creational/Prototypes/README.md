## What is Prototype Pattern after all?
The Prototype pattern is used when creating a new object is expensive or time-consuming. It involves creating a clone or copy of an existing object and modifying it according to the needs of the program.

Here are some examples of where you can use the Prototype pattern:

User Registration: When a new user registers on a website, the system needs to create a new user object with all the necessary fields filled in. Rather than creating a new object from scratch each time, the system can use a prototype user object and clone it, and then modify the cloned object with the user's information.

Game Development: In game development, you can use the Prototype pattern to create copies of game characters or enemies. For example, if you have a game character with certain abilities, you can clone that character and modify its abilities to create a new character with similar abilities.

Document Generation: When generating a large number of documents with similar content, the Prototype pattern can be used to create a prototype document with the desired layout, fonts, and styles. The system can then clone the prototype document and modify it with the specific content for each document.

Database Access: When accessing a database, you can use the Prototype pattern to create a copy of an existing database connection object rather than creating a new connection from scratch each time. This can save time and resources, especially when you have a large number of database requests.

In summary, the Prototype pattern is useful when creating new objects is expensive or time-consuming. It involves creating a clone or copy of an existing object and modifying it to fit the program's needs. Some common use cases include user registration, game development, document generation, and database access.
