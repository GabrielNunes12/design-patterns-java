## Prototype pattern
The Prototype pattern is useful when you want to create new objects that are similar to existing objects, but with some 
minor differences. It saves you the trouble of creating new objects from scratch and setting all their properties again.
Instead, you can just clone an existing object and make some minor modifications to the clone.
